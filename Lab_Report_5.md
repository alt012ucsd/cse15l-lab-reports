I'm having a problem with the following method, that its supposed to reverse an array of integers. When I created a test case using the array `[8, 7, 6, 5]`, it should've produced `[5, 6, 7, 8]` but instead the element 7 was instead 8. I'm not entirely sure what the issue is, but if I had to make a guess it would have to be in the for loop. 

TA Response:

Try creating another test, in which you test the reverse method against an array of only two elements. For example `{1,2}`, to see if the values are being updated correctly or not. Additionally, narrowing down the array to two values allows you to better catch what the issue may be.
